## About the working group
The Liquid Surface Working Group is a gathering of the teams operating the liquid surface scattering instruments at synchrotron and neutron facilities worldwide. We meet virtually every two or three months, usually on Tuesday between 4pm and 6pm to have exchanges on the progress but most importantly, the challenges and perspectives. Each meeting will be hosted by one team (rotating), and the host decides the agenda and the topic.
Currently this working group includes (alphabetical order on the facilities): APS/ChemMatCARS (U Chicago,UIC), BESSY II/ELISA (HZB,FHI), Diamond/I07, ESRF/ID10-SURF, ESS/FREIA, ILL/FIGARO, NSLS-II/12ID-OPLS, ORNL/LIQREF, PETRA III/P08-Langmuir GID, PETRA III/P08-LISA (U Kiel), Soleil/SIRIUS.
