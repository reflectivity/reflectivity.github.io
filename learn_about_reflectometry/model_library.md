We aim at presenting here a series of *real life* sample models together with a description and probably a data set.

The exact format is under debate and for the moment we collect suggestions. If you want to contribute (models or ideas), please contact
[Max](mailto:maximilian.skoda@stfc.ac.uk), [Jochen](mailto:jochen.stahn@psi.ch), [Jos](mailto:Jos.Cooper@ess.eu) or [Tom](mailto:tom.arnold@ess.eu).

We will meet sometime in August to decide on location, form and content of this library.

In the meantime if you would like to submit a model you can do so [here](https://github.com/reflectivity/analysis/tree/master/model_library) 

**You will need to have a github account and be a member of the orso github organisation**

If you are not a member email one of the above to invite you.

If you would prefer not to join github then you can just email us your model and we will add it.
