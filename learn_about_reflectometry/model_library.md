We aim at presenting here a series of *real life* sample models together with a description and probably a data set.

The exact format is under debate and for the moment we collect suggestions. If you want to contribute (models or ideas), please contact
Max, [Jochen](mailto:jochen.stahn@psi.ch) or Tom.

We will meet sometime in August to decide on location, form and content of this library.
