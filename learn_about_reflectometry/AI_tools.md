Artificial Intelligence tools are starting to impact reflectometry (1-3) as they are
+ faster at analysing reflectometry data
+ handle noisy data very well
+ produce fewer outliers than genetic algorithm fits


As reflectometry is an inverse problem - it is easy to calculate the reflectivity given a sample structure, but hard in the inverse direction - supervised learning with synthetic data yields good results. 

Ready made AI models that can be used directly on e.g. a laptop without need for AI training are available under the following link. They work for x-ray and neutron reflectometry curves for film samples with up to three layers:
