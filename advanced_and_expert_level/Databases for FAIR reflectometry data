Overview of VIPR
VIPR aims to develop a flexible software framework for data-driven solutions to inverse problems, which are prevalent in various scientific fields, including photon and neutron research. The project focuses on leveraging invertible neural networks (INNs) to address challenges where traditional direct inversion methods are not applicable due to the loss of essential phase information in experimental data. 
Key Objectives
•	Develop a versatile software framework: Create tools that can handle complex inverse problems across different scientific domains.
•	Implement invertible neural networks (INNs): Utilize INNs to provide efficient and accurate solutions to non-convex optimization problems inherent in inverse problem scenarios.
•	Facilitate user-friendly data analysis: Offer a cloud-based software environment that allows researchers to perform analyses without extensive computational resources. 
Application Areas
The VIPR framework is designed to be applicable in various experimental techniques, including: 
•	Grazing incidence small- and wide-angle scattering (GISAXS and GIWAXS)
•	Neutron and X-ray reflectivity
•	Ptychography
•	Spectroscopy
•	Particle physics 
By addressing the computational challenges associated with inverse problems in these areas, VIPR aims to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of data analysis for researchers working with complex experimental data.

VISA (Virtual Infrastructure for Scientific Analysis)
Overview
VISA is a key outcome of the PaNOSC project, designed to enable remote data analysis at large-scale photon and neutron research facilities. It allows users to process experimental data without needing to download it locally, using powerful compute resources provided by the facilities themselves.
VISA aligns with EOSC (European Open Science Cloud) and FAIR data principles, providing a scalable, federated solution for scientific computing in photon and neutron science.
Key Features
•	Remote Access to Compute Resources
Researchers can run data analysis workflows directly at the facility where the data is stored, minimizing data movement.
•	Federated Authentication
Uses identity federation (e.g., eduGAIN) so users can log in with their home institution credentials. No need to create local accounts at each facility.
•	Supports Standard Tools and Notebooks
VISA instances typically offer:
o	Jupyter Notebooks
o	Command-line access
o	Facility-specific analysis software
o	Visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, PyMca, Mantid)
•	Integrated with Data Portal
Once users discover a dataset via the PaNOSC Data Portal, they can launch a VISA session to analyze it without downloading.
•	Reusable Scientific Workflows
Promotes standardized, reproducible workflows that can be reused across datasets and facilities.
Relationship to Other Components
•	PaNOSC Data Portal: VISA is the compute and analysis backend that complements data discovery.
•	NeXus format: Analysis workflows in VISA often operate directly on NeXus data structures.
•	PaNet and ESRF-ET: Metadata models help select the appropriate workflows or tools in VISA.
•	DAPHNE4NFDI: Potential for alignment on reusable workflows and remote analysis standards within the German NFDI framework.
•	EOSC: VISA is fully aligned with the vision of EOSC for enabling seamless, federated, and FAIR-aligned scientific computing across Europe.
Summary
VISA empowers researchers by:
•	Reducing barriers to data analysis.
•	Supporting collaboration across borders.
•	Enabling efficient use of large-scale data.
•	Promoting reproducibility through standardized workflows.
It represents a significant step forward in making photon and neutron science open, efficient, and FAIR.
