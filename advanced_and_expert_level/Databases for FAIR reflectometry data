**PaNOSC Infrastructures & Related Ecosystem**

**PaNOSC Data Portal**

- Data deposition at each European photon and neutron research facilities (e.g., ESRF, ILL).

**PaNOSC Data Search**

- Central hub to find and access data from European photon and neutron research facilities (e.g., ESRF, ILL).
- Supports cross-facility metadata search using PaNet schema.
- Data Access:
  - Public datasets: freely accessible without login.
  - Restricted datasets: login required via federated identity systems (e.g., eduGAIN).
  - Data are harvested from facility-specific catalogs; end users do not upload manually.
- Challenges: Data is not easily findable e.g. due to missing meta data or developing search engine

**PaNet**

- A metadata schema and ontology developed by PaNOSC.
- Provides a common structure for experimental metadata.
- Enables unified search and machine readability across facilities.

**ESRF-ET (Experiment Technique Ontology)**

- Ontology developed by ESRF for classifying and describing experimental techniques.
- Supports semantic tagging and search refinement in the PaNOSC Data Portal.
- Works in conjunction with PaNet for ontology-based search.

**Related Infrastructures**

**DAPHNE4NFDI**

- German initiative for FAIR data in photon and neutron science.
- Collaborates with PaNOSC on metadata alignment, infrastructure interoperability, and tool integration.
- Focus on national coordination within Germany with international alignment via PaNOSC.

**NOMAD-lab**

- Materials science platform for computational/theoretical data.
- Stores and standardizes data from simulations (e.g., DFT, MD).
- Complements PaNOSC by linking experimental datasets with computational counterparts.
- Shared interest in FAIR principles and metadata interoperability.


**Summary Map**

- NeXus: Core data format used for experimental datasets.
- Orso & ort: Organization for standardization in reflectometry, Reflectometry-specific standards.
- PaNet: Central metadata model for search, harvesting, and interoperability.
- ESRF-ET: Ontology supporting semantic classification of techniques.
- ESRFData Portal: Front-end for search, access, and discovery.
