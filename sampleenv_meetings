Have a sample environment that you would like to discuss with the community? Either because you have a new development
or because you want to discuss possibilities with a group of experienced reflectometry scientists. Contact us the sample environment working group 
(ayscough@ill.fr or humphreys@ill.fr) and we would be happy to organise an event alongside you.
