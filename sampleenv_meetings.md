Do you have a sample environment that you would like to discuss with the community? Either because you have a new development
or because you want to discuss possibilities with a group of experienced reflectometry scientists. Contact us the sample environment working group 
(ayscough@ill.fr or humphreys@ill.fr) and we would be happy to organise an event alongside you. 


## Notes from our meeting on Electrochemical cells 19/11/2025
The session started off with talks from Mary Wood (University of Copenhagen) and Beck Hodgetts (Monash University) on thier experience with electrochemical cell design iterations in thier research. Mary Wood presented the iterative changes in design of the ISIS electrochemical set up optimised to investigate assembly processes of proteins and membranes. Beck Hodgetts presented their design for high-pressure electrochemical measurements and a yet untested sign for co-measurement of electrochemistry, neutron reflectometry and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. Short talks were then given for set ups from different facillities and research groups-a table of which can be found on our sample environment pages covering designs for resarch on batteries, ionic liquids, membranes and electrocatalysis. Discussions were had on struggling with impedance loss, variations in positioning of the electrodes and use of wet reference electrodes vs renewal of pseudo-reference electrodes.
