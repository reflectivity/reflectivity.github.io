The education and outreach working group aims to develop understanding of reflectivity techniques and disseminate information about reflectivity analysis.

The full scope of the working group is:
* **Outreach & Dissemination:** The E&O working group should write news items and publicise the organisation at user meetings and conferences. This should include information on any standards that are established by the other working groups.
* **Website management:** The website is editable by any member of ORSO. The E&O working group is responsible for the content that is outward facing and educational.
* **Organization of annual meetings:** Each working group will have regular virtual meetings covering their specific issues with an annual in-person meeting once a year. The E&O working group will take primary responsibility for organising the annual meeting, and ideally this will be associated as a satellite to a bigger international conference.

To get involved in the E&O working group you should sign up to GitHub and take a look at the GitHub repository or Gitter message board. You can become a member by emailing the working group chair.

Additionally the working group meets every 2 months (on the 1st Thursday of the month at 2pm in the UK) to actively maintain this website.

The next two seesions are:
* Sept 2nd 2021 at 2pm BST (GMT+1)
* Nov 4th 2021 at 2 pm GMT

The Zoom link for this session is always the same. If you would like to participate contact [Tom](mailto:tom.arnold@ess.eu).

Open to all to read, however, an account is required to comment on actions.

### Previous discussions/workshops

At the [2020 workshop](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2020/) the Education & Outreach sessions tried to define the scope of the working group and discussed some detail on the design and content of the website and how to secure the long-term future of the ORSO collaboration. The discussions were wide ranging and agreement was not always reached. However, we were able to establish a list of [actions](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/projects) that will hopefully put the organisation on a firm footing and mean that the website becomes a useful resource for those that are interested in reflectometry at all levels.

At the [2021 workshop](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2021/) the [Education & Outreach sessions](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2021/Friday.md/) focussed on two specific projects. 
* [SLD database project](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/issues/2). The aim of this project is to create a reference tool for commonly used scattering length or electron densities to be made available on the website. An [alpha version]((https://slddb.esss.dk)) has now been created and this was demonstrated at the meeting. Feedback was given at the time and further comments are welcome via the github [issue](https://github.com/reflectivity/edu_outreach/issues/2)
* A discussion of the content of the [tutorial paper](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2021/tutorial_text) in preparation. The aim of this tutorial text is to introduce the model-dependent analysis of specular, non-polarised, neutron and X-ray reflectometry data to those that haven’t seen it before. The text should be comprehensive but basic and should cover both neutron and X-ray reflectometry.
