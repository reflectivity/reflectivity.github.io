## Session 1 & 2: Intro to the Sample Environment Working Group
**09:00-11:00 (UK), 10:00-12:00 (Europe), 04:00-06:00 (US East coast), 18:00-20:00 (Australia East coast):**

then repeated at

**19:00-21:00 (UK), 20:00-22:00 (Europe), 14:00-16:00 (US East coast), 04:00-06:00 (Australia East coast):**

As a new working group of ORSO, the sample environment (S.E.) working group are working on how to improve sample environment for reflectometry but also to increase information sharing on available and developing sample environments. In this session:
- We will have a general discussion session on sample environment identifying the user community needs and discussing the response of the [ORSO questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=HDZmP36oWEGPYZnoLbPKyGNjGj0JBmlFoh6F5vEqATRUNUlaNjU1Mk9CUEFBMElSMVBVMVkyNFFVUC4u&route=shorturl) (30 minutes),
- We will then have more focused mini sessions on solid-liquid flow cells and on troughs, giving the opportunity for groups/facilities that require support to ask questions and find support from partner facilities. (30 minutes)
- Finally will focus on population of the Sample Environment ORSO webpages. We wish to build a comprehensive list of environments available at different facilities, and we hope that you will take this time with us to contribute information on available environments at facilities but also novel sample environments by research groups. We would also in general like to build educational pages on sample environment use. Please attend the session if you are interested in contributing and helping to build what would be a valuable resource for the community. (1 hour)

## Moving towards fully Open Data for Reflectometry
**13:00-14:00 (UK), 14:00-15:00 (Europe), 08:00-09:00 (US East coast), 22:00-23:00 (Australia East coast):**

The move towards open science continues to gather pace, and is becoming well established at central facilities. The situation is less clear for X-ray reflectometry studies conducted in home laboratories. In this session, we review the current landscape and present the latest from the Photon and Neutron Open Science Cluster (PaNOSC) and discuss how we can leverage these developments within the Reflectometry community. We will also explore data catalogues and data support and hold an open discussion to facilitate a gap analysis of needs.

<b> Abstract:</b> DESY, a leading European synchrotron facility, has taken a significant step towards making research data publicly available by establishing a metadata catalogue for data publications. This development is in line with the Open and FAIR data principles, which aim to make data easily discoverable, accessible, and reusable for the wider scientific community. The metadata catalogue, Scicat, provides a comprehensive overview of public research data, making it easier for scientists to find and access relevant data sets. The catalogue is accessible through federated user accounts, allowing community members to log in using their institutional accounts via eduGAIN, HelmholtzID, NFDI, and soon EOSC-AAI.
We also enable scientists to upload their datasets via a self-service portal that provides an easy way of entering all relevant metadata according to predefined metadata schemata, which also allow for automated validation and a curation process that ensures data and metadata quality.
By establishing this infrastructure, DESY is contributing to the growing movement towards Open Science, as requested by funding agencies and scientific journals. The blueprint for DESY’s Open Data solution will be shared with the wider community through HIFIS, NFDI and EOSC, enabling other research institutions to benefit from this development.
The talk will give a short overview of the established services and their architecture. Demonstrating the workflow of minting a DOI for an Open dataset to make it findable from anywhere in the metadata catalogue and subsequently accessing the corresponding dataset itself will be one focus of the talk. Also, general information about the necessity of FAIR and Open Data with persistent identifiers such as DOIs will be given and elaborated.
