## Monday 23rd June: Plenary Sessions

The plenary sessions will introduce ORSO and summarise our activities since the [last meeting](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2024/). 
There will also be some scientific talks on subjects of interest to the ORSO community.
Since the agenda is scheduled to try to cover all time zones, we acknowledge that it may be difficult to attend all these sessions. We will therefore record the plenary sessions and post the videos here after the meeting.
Where feasible we will repeat the breakout discussion sessions in different time zones or attempt to schedule at a time accessible to all. Please bear with us for unsociable meeting times!


### Plenary Session 1
**08:00-10:30 (UK), 09:00-11:30 (Europe), 04:00-06:30 (US East coast), 17:00-19:30 (Australia East coast):**

**Recordings of all talks will be uploaded to the orso youtube channel.**

<summary> Scientific talk: <b>Anton Le Brun, 'Overview and Recent Advances in Sample Environments for Neutron Reflectometry' </b> </summary>
<br>
<b> Abstract:</b> Having the correct sample environment is integral to any part of a neutron scattering experiment as the scientist wishes to make measurements as a function of some external environmental condition. This presentation will present an overview of the latest developments in sample environments in neutron reflectometry with a focus on the reflectometers at the neutron beam facility at the OPAL Research Reactor, ANSTO. Trends in current developments in sample environments determined from analysis of the literature will be discussed highlighting where future developments could be found.

<summary>  Scientific talk:  <b>Michael Haberl, 'Photon-Limited X-Ray Reflectometry: Improved Fitting via the Anscombe Transform'
 </b> </summary>
<br>
<b> Abstract:</b> With the current developments in fast X-ray reflectometry (XRR) reaching
scan times as short as a few hundred microseconds, the few-photon count data reflects the inherent Poisson statistics of the counting process. In this regime, standard least squares fitting - which assumes symmetric Gaussian errors - can produce biased results. While Poisson log-likelihood methods exist, we demonstrate that applying the Anscombe transform - a well known variance-stabilizing transformation that converts Poisson-distributed data into approximately Gaussian-distributed data - permits continued use of the default least squares minimization utilized in most fitting softwares such as refnx or refl1d. This approach simplifies implementation and enables incorporation of additional noise sources, such as readout noise. It offers a practical and robust solution for accurate modeling in photon-limited XRR, relevant to the ORSO reflectometry community.

<summary> Scientific talk: <b>Hiro Aoki, 'Boosting the resolution of time-resolved neutron reflectometry with deep learning' </b> </summary>
<br>
<b> Abstract:</b> Neutron reflectometry (NR) provides sub‑nm structural information at
buried interfaces; however, time‑resolved NR is constrained by the
minutes‑long counting times needed for acceptable statistics. This study
introduces a data‑driven denoising methodology based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to overcome this limitation. One million
synthetic multi-layered structures were generated; for each, both ideal
and noise‑degraded reflectivity profiles were computed to supervise CNN
training. The resulting model was applied to experimental‑style spectra
acquired with 5 % of the usual neutron counts. CNN‑filtered profiles
reproduced layer thicknesses and scattering‑length‑density distributions
obtained from standard exposures within experimental uncertainty. These
results confirm that acquisition times can be shortened by at least an
order of magnitude without compromising analytical accuracy, enabling
second‑scale observation of interfacial kinetics. The proposed approach
shifts the limiting factor in time‑resolved NR from neutron flux to
advanced data processing, substantially expanding the applicability of
this technique to dynamic surface and interface studies.

<summary> Scientific talk: <b>Frank Heinrich, ‘Composition-space modeling in neutron reflectometry from biological and soft matter interfaces.’ </b> </summary>
<br>
<b> Abstract:</b> Composition-space modeling provides a versatile framework for interpreting scattering data from biological and soft matter systems. Rather than starting with abstract layers of scattering length density, this approach builds real-space models based on molecular groups that fill the available volume while satisfying spatial and stoichiometric constraints. From these physically grounded models, the corresponding scattering length density profiles and predicted reflectivity curves are derived and compared to experimental data.
 
This talk will provide an overview of the development and principles of composition-space modeling, highlighting its relevance to systems where components overlap spatially and interact in complex ways. I will present recent applications across neutron reflectometry, X-ray diffraction, and small-angle neutron scattering. I will discuss ongoing efforts at NIST to modernize and extend the modeling framework, including its integration into the Refl1D webview interface. This integration enables real-time visual feedback, streamlining model construction and enhancing accessibility for researchers working with layered biological and soft matter systems.

## Tuesday to Thursday: Breakout discussion sessions

For the discussion sessions we would like to ask one of the attendees to act as a scribe to keep some notes on the discussion. This person should be able to attend the final plenary session on Friday and give a report about what happened in the discussion. For further details on the breakout sessions, please see the separate pages for each day:

### [Tuesday 24th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/tuesday.md)

### [Wednesday 25th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/wednesday.md/)

### [Thursday 26th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/thursday.md)

## Friday 27th June: Concluding Plenary Session

In the final session of the workshop we will summarise the working group discussions and look to the future with some further science talks

<summary> Scientific talk: <b>David P. Hoogerheide, 'The CANDOR polychromatic reflectometer' </b> </summary>
<br>
<b> Abstract:</b> The CANDOR reflectometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research marries the advantages of time-of-flight polychromatic reflectometers, such as those commonly employed at pulsed neutron sources, to the high time-averaged flux of a reactor neutron source. CANDOR’s unique energy dispersive detector, currently comprising 108 individual wavelength-sensitive neutron detectors operating at over 90% efficiency, allows simultaneous detection of cold neutrons in the 4 Å to 6 Å wavelength range. In this talk, I will describe instrument design, detector operation and performance, and data reduction considerations. Reflectivity curves measured by CANDOR using polychromatic detection will be compared to standard curves measured at NIST’s monochromatic reflectometers, and the performance of CANDOR’s polarization capabilities will be discussed. For measurements of materials at solid/liquid interfaces, I will show that CANDOR’s high flux and intrinsic background rejection enables measurement to about twice the scattering vector, and hence resolution, of conventional measurements.
